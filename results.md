This suggests that the brightness level might be adjusted through a slider or another interactive element not explicitly listed. Given the previous actions and the current UI elements, it seems that the next step would involve interacting with the 'Brightness level' element, which is already selected. Since the exact control to adjust the brightness is not visible in the list, I need to confirm the current status. The reasoning for this action is to ensure that the brightness level can be adjusted to the maximum value once the appropriate control is identified."}
